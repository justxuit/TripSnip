    We are a group of students from the institute of Grand Circus located in Detroit who are looking to give back to this great city. Over the course of 10 weeks, we've immersed ourselves in the world of front-end development and have obtained the skills to address the disparity between the size of Detroitâ€™s technology workforce and the need for those with tech talent. We believe TripSnip will motivate people to travel, collect, share, and compare their adventures with family and friends in a fun and easy way.
